TinyBasic Plus
==============
This is the version with VGAX and PS2 Keyboard support. I will 
modify this program to add more features like maybe graphics 
commands or just some other random thing that I come up with.
This uses pin 10 for rx and pin 11 for tx. This was modified
to work with my arduino leonardo, it will work with most of
the other common arduino platforms.
